# ISAAC ProductReports Magento module

The ISAAC Product Reports extension provides administrator(s) with two extra product reports that help to keep your catalog healthy. One report shows all products that are not assigned to any category and the other shows all products without images. The products are presented in a grid that supports paging and filtering.
