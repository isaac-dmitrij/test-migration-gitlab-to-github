# ISAAC ProductReports Magento module

The ISAAC Product Reports extension provides administrator(s) with two extra product reports that help to keep your catalog healthy. One report shows all products that are not assigned to any category and the other shows all products without images. The products are presented in a grid that supports paging and filtering.

## Features

The following reports are added to the 'Reports | Products' menu of the admin panel:

* ___Without category___: shows all products that are not assigned to any category.
* ___Without image___: shows all products without images.

Each report shows a paged and searchable grid containing the products that match the criteria. When clicking on a link the user is redirected to the corresponding tab or the edit product page.

Translations include English and Dutch.

Compatible with Magento versions 1.4.1 and later.
